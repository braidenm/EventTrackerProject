## WEEK 11 HOME-WORK (Event Tracker REST Project)

## WEEK 12 HOME-WORK UPDATE
 
Used angular to build the front end. was not able to fully implement all of the features set up in the back end. Basic functionality works: see a list of trips and click on one to see the activities associated with that trip. Add activities, edit the trip details, or delete the trip from the main page. Clicking on an activity will open a new window with more details about that activity including the start and end dates, description, and categories. Add more categories, edit the activity detail, or delete the activity. 

### Stretch Goals

* Attach a user aspect (only see relevent info.) -> java(entity, tested, repository, and controller completed)      
* Include address information with map  -> java and Database side completed
* Include pictures -> Databse schema completed
* include search features (text box search) -> Java and Database side completed
* Have comments on trips, activities, pictures, and users -> Database completed
* Include expense forms for Trips, Activities, and total for the user -> Database side completed
* view other users profiles


## Description

Keep track of your trips by logging details about who went, the dates, what activities, comments, expenses, and location. Users that are not logged in can see trips and certain details. Create an account and be able to set up trips, edit details, and even delete(deactivate) the trip. signed in as an admin will allow for more details on everything and be able to actually delete or reactivate content/users. The admin can also ban users from the site. 



## Requirements

The application  was created to satisfy the following requirements:

- A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to the Java
code using JPA.

- C.R.U.D, manipulating objects and saving them in an
appropriate database table.

- Set up a Spring REST project and impliment: 
    ** JPA entities with J-Unit tests
    ** Create Repositories (data accessing objects using the interface JPARepositories)
    ** Create a service class to add logic to the data
    ** Create a REST controller with API's taking in requests and sending back data
    
- Test API connections with POST MAN
    
- Deploy to AWS

## Technology Used

Angular, JavaSCript, RESTful services, API, JPA, MySQL, CRUD, AWS, JUnit testing.
